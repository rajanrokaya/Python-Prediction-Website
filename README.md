# Python Prediction Website



## Getting started

To run the project in your IDE, you have to install all the python packages like numpy, matplotlib and flask. After installing all the packages, you can go to the main.py file and run the project. Go to http://localhost:8000 to run the web project in your browser. As the project has it's debug mode turned on, any changes in the python file will also change the look in the browser. Have fun.


## Web Project

This Python project was made with the help of Flask. The prediction calculator will take sometime to find the result, so you would have to wait to get the result. The waiting time depends on the year you have given to the calculator, as the higher year you feed the calculator, it has to predict more, and thus will take more time to get the result.
The data for the calculator was taken from https://www.destatis.de/. The data was web-scapped and then made a csv file. Then the csv file with the help of matplotlib was used to visualize the data on the browser. As the hover effect didn't work with matplotlib, Chart.js was used to see the yearly data. To find, how javascript was used, you have to click on the picture, which will lead to another page.
