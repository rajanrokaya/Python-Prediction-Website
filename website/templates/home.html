<!--
It looks like this template is a homepage for a web application. The template includes a form with a single input
field for a year and a submit button labeled "Predict." When the form is submitted, the application uses the year
provided in the input field to make predictions for both import and export trade and displays the predicted values
and their corresponding accuracy. The template also includes conditionals to check if predictions were made before
displaying the results. Overall, it seems like this template is used to display a form for making trade predictions
based on a year input.
