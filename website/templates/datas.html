<!--The above code is a template written in Jinja2, a templating engine for the Python programming language, and HTML.
It defines a webpage that displays a table of data with columns for "Year", "Exports", and "Imports". The table data is
passed to the template through a variable called "data" and looped through with a for loop to display each row of data.
The template extends a base template called "base.html" which defines the overall structure and style of the webpage.
The title of the webpage is set to "Datas" and the main content of the webpage is the table displaying the data.
-->
